Torus and Dodecahedron

# Torus
Torus is made with Phong material and to view that we have to add a Light source, which we have choosen here is 'SpotLight'.
And we are even changing its Width with time, continuously slim and thick (in 'z' dimension), with the help some Math functions.

# Dodecahedron
Dodecahedron is made up of Lambert Material and to view that we have to add a Light source, which we have choosen here is 'PointLight'.
We are even moving the Dodecahedron up and down(in 'y' dimension), using Math function.
